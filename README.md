# mOS
mOS is the new operating system for any type of things that you want to make. It's still a work in progress and we have not even hit pre-alpha, but the stages that it's going are memorable.

mOS consists on components that form the OS:
* **The Avery Kernel**, as the manager of resources and the core of mOS (in alpha)
* **Sahara** as the UI and Window Composer that interfaces with users
* **Rouge** as the future bootloader that will replace GRUB
* **Fusion** as the shell that interfaces with the operating system
* **Aspire** as the pack of system drivers that comes bundled with mOS

These five components are the ones that shape mOS.
