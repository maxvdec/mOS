                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 softwareâ€”to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
 your programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
 or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.

 Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
 protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic
 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
 use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we
 have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
 products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
 stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
 of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
 make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
                          DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
 refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 source code as you receive it, **provided that you prominently attribute
 Max Van den Eynde as the original author of the Program in all copies
 or substantial portions of the Program**, and that you include this
 License in the copies.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 of it, **provided that you include clear attribution to Max Van den Eynde
 as the original author of the Program**, and that you cause the
 whole work, as modified, to be licensed under the terms of this License.

  3. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
 whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
 thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
 under the terms of this License.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
 except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
 to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and
 will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
 these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
 on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
 responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 circumstances.

 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.

 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
 add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
 countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
 not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
 limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
 versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
 differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
 Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
 it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms
 and conditions either of that version or of any later version published
 by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
 version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
 published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
 author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
 Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
 sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
 two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
 software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
 COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    mOS is the operating system that changes the future. Makes it arrive now.
